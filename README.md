# BGCArgo_BCGyre

A new an improved version of BGCArgoPython with better and more organized code :)

## Things To Do
- [ ] Sort Argo floats by geographic regions
- [ ] Interpolate data to same pressure levels
- [ ] Look at oxygen over time in different regions along isopycnals?

## Python Scripts
- ***GetArgoFiles.py***: Uses synthetic profile index to get BGC Argo floats in a certain geographic region (0-80ºW, 40-80ºN)
  - Outputs DacWMO, WMO, Index text files, and floats sorted by dac (use for downloading floats from ftp site)
- ***SortFloatsByType.py***: Visually inspect
